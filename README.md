# Introduction

SLMS is a simple server solution which provides managable short links for your domain. You can create, edit and delete short links in a simple web interface which will relocate the user of these links to the defined root link location. Each *(uncached)* access will be recorded *(anonymously)* to provide simple access analytics.

# Why v.2.0?

I realy had intrest on resuming developing on this project and I wanted to get deeper into creating REST API's with go. So I thought about experimenting with `fasthttp` and `fasthttp-routing` instead of `net/http` and `gorilla/mux` *(which I have used in v.1.0)*. Also, I wanted to enhance the project layout and the database structure, so I've decided to re-create this whole project.
